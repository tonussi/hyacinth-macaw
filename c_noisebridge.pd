#X text 104 127 To use the a_compound is really simple. To create one
you type ctrl+1 and type inside the box a_compound this is a compound
to make sound trought Zynaddsubfx or any other midi synthetizer you
might prefer. But this one needs to be able to make connection with
Puredata using Jack Routing. I am saying that because I do not know
other ways to make that happen. So \, ok. The colored grid is a grid
with 0's and 1's this grid will toggle the sequencer \, so you can
make combinations fast. The grid have a simple meckanism to randomize
the matrix \, so you can do combinations more quickly. The principle
of the randomize was used often on the a_compound. The Box Delay \,
Velocity \, Channel is a box to control the makenote object (pd's native)
\, quite simple right ? The randseq is a box to make random values
to the sequencer multiplications its another way to make combinations
and create diferente compositions. The box bellow its a box to start
the compound \, it contains a simple metronome from 100 to 5000 The
left is a keyboard with 16 keys \, each key have from 1 to 127 midinotes
\, each key also have a upper led signalling that the key are being
played or not. This piano have at his top a meckanism to make random
note positions and to make this continously (with a metronome). Easy
to use.;
